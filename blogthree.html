        <p class="container container-center">
            From just 200 liters of milk procurement in a day in 1948 to now 215 lakh liters a day, how did Amul become
            the Amul that it is today? Amul’s revenue as of 2019–2020 is 5.4 Billion dollars. How did they end up
            becoming not just India but Asia’s largest dairy industry?

            Amul's Story dates back to pre-independence in 1943. The milk market was entirely monopolized by a Parsi
            brand named Polson. Around 1942–43, a large number of Britishers stationed in Bombay fell sick. After an
            intensive investigation, the authorities identified the root of the problem as the milk they were drinking.
            A sample of this milk was sent for testing to a laboratory in London since the British would not trust any
            Indian laboratory. There was a one-line response from London. It said quite simply: ‘The milk of Bombay is
            more polluted than the gutter water of London.

            Amul’s system has succeeded mainly because of the involvement of people on such a large scale, providing
            assured market at remunerated prices for milk producers, enables the 55 consumers to access high-quality
            milk and milk products, plowing back the profit to the members, part of the profit is used by the society
            for the common good and community development. Amul has established itself as a uniquely appropriate model
            for rural development. Amul has spurred the white revolution of India, which has made India the largest
            producer of milk and milk products in the world. Amul products have been in use in millions of homes since
            1946. Today Amul is a symbol of many things like high-quality products sold at reasonable prices & the
            genesis of a vast cooperative network. Its supply chain is easily one of the most complicated in the world.
            The supply chain links farmer-suppliers of milk with millions of consumers. Amul encourages women and
            farmers to collect milk from their cows and pass it on to them for a price directly eliminating the cost of
            middlemen. The introduction of a just-in-time inventory strategy improves dealers’ return on investment
            (ROI). Amul was one of the first FMCG firms in India to employ Internet technologies to implement B2C
            commerce. Today customers can order a variety of products through the Internet and be assured of timely
            delivery with cash payment upon receipt. It has also implemented a Geographical Information System (GIS) at
            both ends of the supply chain, i.e. milk collection as well as the marketing process.

            This is how Amul is what it is, did you like the story?
