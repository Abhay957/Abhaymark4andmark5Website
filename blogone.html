        <h1 class="hero-heading">3  Reasons why you should limit Cardio during Fat-loss</h1>
        <p class="container container-center">For the common masses, cardio has become synonymous with fat loss. “You want to lose weight? Start running!”, is by far the most common fat-loss advice you will get.

            As of 2019, the mainstream image is that cardio is what you do to lose fat and get “toned”. Whereas, weight training is what you do to build muscle and look “bulky”. Naturally, with such a reputation in the air, most women stay away from lifting weights and stick to the treadmill, and maybe a couple of belly exercises at best.
            
            But is that even true? Is doing lots of cardio the correct way to lose fat and get in shape?
            
            Newsflash: Not only is it total bullshit, but worse, doing only cardio to lose weight is a sure shot way to ruin your body composition and end up being skinny fat. (Someone who looks slim in clothes, but totally out of shape without them. Yeah, that’d suck.)
            
            There are big million-dollar businesses out there whose marketing strategy is solely based on the premise that, “Our HIIT workouts are specially designed to give you a toned body”. On top of that, for an average person, watching their favorite greek god/goddess celebrity endorsing these brands only strengthens the notion of cardio/HIIT being the ultimate go-to option for losing fat and getting in shape.
            
            Oh, what a mess. Don’t get me wrong, cardio sure has it’s place in an overall training plan and certainly offers it’s own unique set of benefits. But doing only cardio alone is perhaps the most stupid training plan for someone looking to lose fat and get in shape, which sadly is what 95% of people do.
            
            So, how much cardio should you do and how much is too much? Does cardio plays a pivotal role in losing fat?
            
            Here are 3 reasons why cardio should not be the bread and butter of your fat-loss training plan.
            
            NOTE: This article is addressed to people who primarily want to improve their health markers and get in shape, which I believe describes 99% of people who ever start exercising or running. And not to someone looking to train optimally for improving performance in some endurance sports, like “run-time” in marathons.

                Ha! Isn’t that a deal breaker.

Cardio is not what causes you to lose fat. A calorie deficit is the only thing makes your body lose fat. At the end of the day, your body only knows the energy balance that you are in. If you eat less calories than what you burn throughout the day, you will lose fat. Otherwise, you will not.

Sure, doing cardio burns some calories, increasing the energy out side of the equation (the red bar). But you can do all the cardio you want, if you are not eating in a net calorie deficit, you will not lose fat. Period. [1]

I say that because the calories you burn during cardio are only a handful anyway, equivalent of 3-4 cookies at best. And if someone is not counting their calorie intake (the green bar), all the time and sweat invested in doing cardio can be washed away in a minute.

So, it is just not practically possible to create a meaningful calorie deficit by doing cardio alone. Reducing your energy intake (food) is what is going to create the majority of your calorie deficit.

The role of cardio in fat loss is thus only supplemental at best. And cardio is certainly not the sole driver of fat loss.

Pro Tip: Even if the cardio which you choose to do has a reputation of burning more fat as fuel while doing it, like fasted cardio or HIIT sessions, it does not means more fat loss overall! At the end of 24 hours, the net fat loss would still be dictated by the net calorie deficit. You see, if you burn more fat during exercise, you end up burning less fat and more carbs during the rest of the day.
